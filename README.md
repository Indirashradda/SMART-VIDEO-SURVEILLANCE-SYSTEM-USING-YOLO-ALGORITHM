# SMART-VIDEO-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM-USING-YOLO-ALGORITHM

The main object of the project is to enhance the existing security system, like CCTV. The main drawback of CCTV is that it only monitors but wonâ€™t detect and notify the irregularity in the environment. The real time image that we get from the CCTV should be manually monitored. The continuous monitor from human is needed in case of restricted area if we are using the regular security system. Human tend to do error when doing the continues monitoring. Security systems are mainly used for preventing the disturbance occurred in the specified region. So, we can say continues monitoring is unnecessary when there is no disturbance.  The project focuses on solving this problem. 
Smart surveillance system using yolo algorithm project does the most of the work that are done by a person who is monitoring the real time image captured by security system. For example, if we consider a restricted area and there is a CCTV which monitor that area, if a person enters the area, then the captured real time will be processed and warning message will be sent to the respected person.
